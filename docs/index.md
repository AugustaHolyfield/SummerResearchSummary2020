# Summer 2020: Reflections

#One Thing I will take away from this experience
  Over the course of this summer, I have learned many valuable skills in remote collaboration using the internet. I have refined and built on my skills working with the scala coding language, Jupyter notebooks, and using GitHub to coordinate projects. Given current events, I think these skills will be increasingly useful for this coming semester. They will also be helpful as I move into a bigger leadership role in HCMID.
  
  
#One thing I am thinking about doing
  This project introduced me to working with the Homer Multitext Project. Before this summer I had not edited any ancient Greek texts or any manuscript scholia. After this summer, I am interested in continuing to work with this material and to expand my knowledge of these manuscripts. Short term, I would like to continue to work with the Manuscripts, Inscriptions, and Documents Club, hopefully on the Homer team's work. In the long term, as I develop my senior thesis I will keep the ideas and methods from this project in mind as I consider potential topics, materials, and approaches.
